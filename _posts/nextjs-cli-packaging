## Introduction

Have you ever wanted to distribute a Next.js application as part of a CLI tool? Maybe you're building a monorepo with multiple packages, and one of them needs to serve a web interface on demand. This was exactly the challenge I faced recently, and after some trial and error, I found a clean solution.

In this post, I'll walk you through the complete process of packaging a Next.js app as an npm package that can be programmatically started by a CLI command.

## The Use Case

Picture this: you're building a developer tool like `drizzle studio` or `mastra dev` where users install your CLI package and can run commands like:

```bash
your-tool dev
# or
your-tool dashboard
```

This command should spin up a web interface where users can manage configurations, view data, or interact with your tool through a nice UI. Think of how Drizzle Kit launches a database browser, or how Mastra opens a development dashboard - that's exactly what I was trying to build.

## The Challenge

I needed to create a CLI package in my monorepo that could spin up a Next.js application on demand. The tricky part was figuring out how to:

1. Build the Next.js app in a way that could run independently
2. Package only the necessary files for npm distribution  
3. Programmatically start the server from another package

## Step 1: Creating a Standalone Build

The key to making this work is Next.js's `standalone` output mode. This feature creates a self-contained version of your app that includes only the necessary files and dependencies.

First, I updated the `next.config.js` file:

```javascript
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'standalone'
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```

This tells Next.js to create a standalone build that can run independently without the original `node_modules` directory. You can read more about this feature in the [Next.js documentation on standalone output](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/config/next-config-js/output#automatically-copying-traced-files).

## Step 2: Copying Required Assets

The standalone build doesn't automatically include static assets, so I needed to copy them manually. I added these scripts to my `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build:sync": "cp -r public .next/standalone/my-app && mkdir -p .next/standalone/my-app/.next/ && cp -r .next/static .next/standalone/my-app/.next/static",
    "build": "next build && pnpm build:sync"
  }
}
```

**Important note**: Replace `my-app` with your actual directory name. Next.js creates the standalone build in a directory that matches your project's folder name.

Here's what these commands do:
- Copy the `public` directory to the standalone build
- Create the `.next` directory structure within the standalone build (Next.js expects this directory structure to exist at runtime)
- Copy the static assets that Next.js generates

## Step 3: Configuring the Package for npm

To publish only the standalone build (not the entire Next.js project), I configured the `package.json` with specific export settings:

```json
{
  "main": ".next/standalone/server.js",
  "exports": {
    ".": "./.next/standalone/server.js",
    "./package.json": "./package.json"
  },
  "files": [
    ".next/standalone"
  ],
  "publishConfig": {
    "access": "public",
    "registry": "https://registry.npmjs.org/"
  }
}
```

This configuration:
- Sets the main entry point to the generated `server.js`
- Defines explicit exports for the package
- Ensures only the `.next/standalone` directory is included in the published package
- Configures npm publishing settings

## Step 4: Running the App Programmatically

Now comes the interesting part - starting the Next.js server from another package in the monorepo. I created a function to resolve the path to the published package:

```javascript
import { createRequire } from 'node:module';
import { dirname, join } from 'node:path';

const require = createRequire(import.meta.url);

function resolveWebRuntime() {
  try {
    // Resolve the path to the installed package
    const pkg = require.resolve('your-package-name/package.json');
    const root = dirname(pkg);
    return join(root, '.next/standalone/my-app');
  } catch (err) {
    throw new Error(`Could not find package. ${err}`);
  }
}
```

Finally, I used Node.js's `fork` method to spawn the server process:

```javascript
import { fork } from 'node:child_process';

function startServer() {
  const rootPath = resolveWebRuntime();
  const entry = join(rootPath, 'server.js');
  const port = 3000;
  const host = 'localhost';

  const child = fork(entry, [], {
    cwd: rootPath,
    env: {
      ...process.env,
      NODE_ENV: 'production',
      PORT: String(port),
      HOSTNAME: host,
    },
    stdio: 'inherit',
  });

  // Handle graceful shutdown
  process.on('SIGINT', () => {
    console.log('ðŸ›‘ Stopping server...');
    child.kill('SIGINT');
    process.exit(0);
  });

  process.on('SIGTERM', () => {
    child.kill('SIGTERM');
    process.exit(0);
  });

  return child;
}
```

## Why This Approach Works

The standalone build created by Next.js includes:
- A `server.js` file that can start an HTTP server
- All the necessary application code and dependencies
- Optimized production builds of your pages and components

By packaging only this standalone directory and providing a programmatic way to start it, you get:
- **Smaller package size**: Only essential files are published
- **Independence**: The app can run without the original development setup
- **Flexibility**: Easy to integrate into CLI tools or other Node.js applications

## Key Takeaways

1. **Use Next.js standalone output**: This is crucial for creating a self-contained build
2. **Don't forget static assets**: The build process doesn't automatically copy `public` and `.next/static` directories
3. **Configure package.json carefully**: Proper exports and file inclusion ensure your package works correctly
4. **Handle process lifecycle**: Implement graceful shutdown handling for production use

This pattern has worked great for building CLI tools that need web interfaces, allowing you to distribute interactive dashboards as part of command-line tools while keeping everything nicely packaged and manageable.

## What's Next?

You could extend this approach by:
- Adding configuration options for port and host
- Implementing health checks
- Adding logging and monitoring
